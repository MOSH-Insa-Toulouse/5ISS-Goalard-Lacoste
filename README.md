## Course objectives
The main objective of this class is to provide a transversal perspective of the creation of an IoT system. From the solution proposal to the end of system design, we take a look at all the conception steps, trying to merge both the hardware and software requirements.

## Project desciption
This project is a sequel to the Gas Sensor conception did at the AIME lab in october. The idea is the following : now we have a working gas sensor, we want to integrate it in on an electronic card to collect data from its environment and send over a low speed network. As it is multidisciplinary, we divided the project in various steps : 
* Gas sensor conception
* Data communication via LoRa
* Online data retrieving
* Harware & PCB design
